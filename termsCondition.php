                            unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our
                            negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or
                            fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Event

                    <ol class="fs-25 text-justify">
                        <li>We may, at our sole discretion, refuse access to the venue to any third party service
                            provider instructed by you if we consider that their presence will impact or affect the

                    <ol class="fs-25 text-justify">
                        <li>We may transfer this Contract to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations
                            under these terms and conditions to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing
                            if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the
                            Contract.</li>
                        <li>You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else. You may only transfer your
                            rights or your obligations under these terms and conditions to another person if we agree to
                            this in writing.</li>
                        <li>Nobody else has any rights under this Contract. This Contract is between you and us. No
                            other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms and conditions.</p>
                        <li>If a court finds part of this Contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the
                            paragraphs of these terms and conditions operates separately. If any court or relevant
                            authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in
                            full force and effect.</li>
                        <li>Even if we delay in enforcing this Contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not
                            insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms and
                            conditions, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this
                            Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent
                            us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do
                            not chase you, but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the
                            payment at a later date.</li>
